# credit-risk-classification

An overview of the analysis: Youâ€™ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

The results: The logistic regression model performs exceptionally well in predicting healthy loans (0) with a precision and recall of nearly 100%. However, while it also performs well for high-risk loans (1), there is a slight drop in precision (84%) and recall (94%). This means that while the model is good at identifying high-risk loans, there is still some room for improvement

A summary: Overall, the model demonstrates strong performance, with a very high accuracy and good balance between precision and recall across both classes so i will use it.
